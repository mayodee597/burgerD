# burgerD


In this assignment, I created a retaurant app that allowed users to input the names of burgers that they would like to eat. The user was able to submit a burger name and the name was deployable. Each burger had a "Devour It" button which the user can click and the burger will move and be displayed.  The App was then deployed on to GitHub and Heroku.
